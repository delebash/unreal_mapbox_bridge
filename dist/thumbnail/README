This shows an example of how to use the GDAL API from within a web browser to
generate a thumbnail from a GeoTIFF using GDALTranslate.  This thumbnail will
not be warped, so it is not necessarily suitable for display on a map.

To use, first make sure that `gdal.js`, `gdal.js.mem`, and `gdal.data` are
available in this directory. There are some symlinks provided that will do this
automatically if you build the project from source. Alternatively, you can
[download a release](https://github.com/ddohler/gdal-js/releases) and place the
files in this directory manually.

Next, start up an HTTP server to serve this folder. For example, `python -m
SimpleHTTPServer`. Navigate to whatever port your server is listening at, and
follow the instructions on the page.
