SharedBufferArray needs certain headers.  This is configured in vite config but does not work for vite preview

Pwa install for some reason does not show up to install when running vite preview

Temporary solution:
npm run ssl.  After the server launches once you can close server and just use vite for dev and hotmodule reload

If you just want to run a server from dist directory run npm run serve.  You will need to build the project to see any
changes in dist
